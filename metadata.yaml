description: Rosalie Vanderpoel, daughter of a wealthy American, marries into a British
  family of aristocrats, only to discover that they are impoverished. She is unable
  to contact her family back home and her sister Bettina, having become suspicious,
  travels to England to find out what happened. When she arrives, her money and spunk
  revitalize the English society she comes in contact with, suggesting that Britain
  needs to adopt an American mentality if it is to improve its future.
